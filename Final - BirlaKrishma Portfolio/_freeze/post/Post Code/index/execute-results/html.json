I then used a code to read and recognize Data_RLab5 (1).cvs. I excluded lowbirthweight from the dataset.\n\nMoreover, I analyzed the data format in Data_RLab5 (1).cvs. I also checked the variables format. I then located and put in values that were absent (when it comes to variables that are numeric, the median was used. Additionally, the mode was used in term of variables of categories). Finally, using absolute value, my code finds the variable that is most highly correlated in terms of the target variable. My code then displays the linear regression (target variable vs the variable with the most correlation). From the linear regression model, there appears to be a positive correlation in terms of weeks and weight because as the pregnancy weeks progressed, so did the infant's birth weight.\n",
